# Emoji Translator

The Emoji Translator is a lightweight web tool that converts typed words or short phrases into pixel-based shapes and emojis displayed on a simulated flipdot grid (84×28 px, black & white, 15 fps).  
This project was created to explore how well text and simple shapes can be translated into low-resolution visuals for the OWOW Flipdots Hub.
